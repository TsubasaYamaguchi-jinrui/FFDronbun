<p>前章までの分析により、<em>TY</em>と<em>IT</em>が群れを出入りすることが群れ本体における確認メス割合に影響している可能背うが高いことが分かった。それでは、実際にそれぞれのメスはどのようなメカニズムで群れを出るか否かを決めているのだろうか?</p>
<p>以下では、メスの毎日の確認状況のデータからメスが群れを離れる要因を探る(図<a href="10_female_out_analysis.html#fig:female-out">9.1</a>)。オスの出入りの他、彼らとの親密度、アカンボウの有無、発情の有無、オスの攻撃などの要因を検討する。</p>

以下は、<em>TY</em>とのCSIに応じて、<em>TY</em>が群れを離れた日に群れを離れる確率が、そうでない日に比べて有意に高いかを調べたものである。Differenceは、Level1とLevel2のログオッズの差(= ログオッズ比)を示す。0より大きければ、<em>TY</em>が群れを離れなかった日に比べて、<em>TY</em>が群れを離れた日にメスが群れを離れる確率が高かったことを表す。この結果から、おおよそCSIが1.1より大きいメスは<em>TY</em>が群れを離れるのと同じ日に群れを離れる確率が有意に上昇することが示された。</p>

<p>先ほどのモデルでは<em>TY</em>と<em>IT</em>が群れを離れたか否かにだけ注目したが、<em>TY</em>と<em>IT</em>が群れを離れなかったときには、大きく分けて2つのパターンがある。</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>前日にそもそも群れにいなかった(<code>TY_absent</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>前日に群れにいて、翌日も群れで確認された(<code>TY_stay</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>ここでは、これらの2つも区別したモデルを考える。モデルでは<em>TY</em>と<em>IT</em>が群れを離れた(<code>TY/IT_out</code>)、<code>TY/IT_absent</code>、<code>TY/IT_stay</code>の3つの水準を持つ変数<code>TY/IT_state</code>を作成し、先ほどのモデルの<code>TY_out</code>の代わりに入れる(図<a href="10_female_out_analysis.html#fig:TYITstate">9.2</a>)。</p>

<p>まず全期間のデータを用いたモデルでは、残差の自己相関をプロットすると明確なパターンは見られなかった。また、Ljung-Box検定で5時点前までの残差との自己相関を検定したところ、有意な自己相関を示した個体はMifとTenだけだった。</p>

<p>最後に残差の時系列相関のチェックを行う。</p>
<p>まず全期間のデータを調べた。残差の自己相関をプロットすると、明確なパターンは見られなかった。また、Ljung-Box検定で3時点前(発情時のデータは少ないため、4時点以降だとデータがない個体が多い)までの残差との自己相関を検定したところ、有意な自己相関を示した個体はKit, Meiのみだった。</p>

さらに交互作用項のある変数について検討を行う。以下は、<em>TY</em>とのCSIに応じて、<em>TY</em>が群れを離れた日に群れを離れる確率が、そうでない日に比べて有意に高いかを調べたものである。Differenceはログオッズ比を示し、0より大きければ、<em>TY</em>が群れを離れなかった日に比べて、<em>TY</em>が群れを離れた日にメスが群れを離れる確率が高かったことを表す。この結果から、いずれのCSIでも有意な差はなかったことが分かった。</p>
